# Bug Fixes Applied

## 1. TOTP Bug Fix ✅
**Issue**: When adding an account without TOTP and navigating to TOTP screen, tapping "add" showed "All accounts already have TOTP configured" even when no accounts existed.

**Root Cause**: The TOTP screen was receiving an empty accounts list from navigation and not loading accounts properly.

**Fix**: 
- Updated `TOTPManagementScreen` to accept `VaultManager` and `VaultEncryptionService` 
- Implemented proper account loading using the same pattern as `HomeScreen`
- Fixed the logic in `_addTOTPToAccount()` to check `_allAccounts.isEmpty` instead of `widget.accounts.isEmpty`
- Added appropriate error messages for different scenarios

**Code Changes**:
- Modified `main_navigation_screen.dart` to pass vault manager and encryption service
- Updated `totp_management_screen.dart` constructor and account loading logic
- Fixed null safety issues and removed unused imports

## 2. Performance Optimization ✅
**Issue**: App felt laggy due to multiple stream subscriptions and frequent rebuilds in TOTP widgets.

**Fix**: Replaced stream subscriptions with simple Timer-based updates in `lib/widgets/totp_code_widget.dart`:
- Removed `StreamSubscription` objects that were creating multiple listeners
- Replaced with single `Timer.periodic` that updates every second
- Reduced memory usage and CPU overhead
- Maintained same functionality with better performance

**Code Changes**:
- Replaced `_codeSubscription` and `_remainingSubscription` with `_updateTimer`
- Simplified update logic to use direct method calls instead of streams
- Proper timer cleanup in dispose methods

## Testing
To test these fixes:
1. Create an account without TOTP
2. Navigate to TOTP screen - should now load and display existing accounts
3. Tap the "+" button - should show appropriate message based on account state
4. App should feel more responsive, especially when viewing multiple accounts with TOTP codes

## Status: FIXED ✅
Both issues have been resolved:
- TOTP screen now properly loads accounts from the current vault
- Performance has been optimized by reducing unnecessary stream subscriptions
- Proper error handling and user feedback implemented
