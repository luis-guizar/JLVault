# Auto-Lock Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of automatic app locking functionality in the Simple Vault password manager. The feature ensures that the app requires biometric authentication every time it's accessed after being backgrounded, providing enhanced security for stored passwords.

## Problem Statement

The original app implementation had a security vulnerability where:
- Authentication was only required on initial app launch
- Once authenticated, users could background the app and return without re-authentication
- This left sensitive password data accessible if someone gained physical access to an unlocked device

## Solution Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. App Lifecycle Management (`main.dart`)
- **StatefulWidget with WidgetsBindingObserver**: Monitors app lifecycle state changes
- **Authentication State Tracking**: Maintains boolean flag for user authentication status
- **Background Time Tracking**: Records when app goes to background
- **Authentication Time Tracking**: Records when authentication completes to prevent loops

#### 2. Lock Screen Integration (`lock_screen.dart`)
- **Callback-based Authentication**: Uses callback pattern to notify parent of successful authentication
- **Biometric Integration**: Leverages device's native biometric authentication
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of authentication failures and device compatibility

#### 3. Home Screen Integration (`home_screen.dart`)
- **Manual Lock Option**: Lock button in app bar for immediate locking
- **Logout Callback**: Receives callback to trigger manual app locking

### Implementation Details

#### App Lifecycle State Management

```dart
@override
void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
  switch (state) {
    case AppLifecycleState.paused:
      // Record when app goes to background
      _lastBackgroundTime = DateTime.now();
      break;
    case AppLifecycleState.resumed:
      // Check if re-authentication is needed
      if (_isAuthenticated && _lastBackgroundTime != null) {
        // Prevent authentication loops during biometric prompt
        final justAuthenticated = _lastAuthenticationTime != null && 
            DateTime.now().difference(_lastAuthenticationTime!).inSeconds < 5;
        
        if (!justAuthenticated) {
          setState(() {
            _isAuthenticated = false;
          });
        }
      }
      break;
  }
}
```

#### Authentication Flow

1. **Initial Launch**: App starts with `_isAuthenticated = false`, shows LockScreen
2. **Authentication Success**: LockScreen calls `onAuthenticated()` callback
3. **State Update**: Main app sets `_isAuthenticated = true` and records timestamp
4. **Home Screen Display**: App shows HomeScreen with user's passwords
5. **Background Detection**: App records `_lastBackgroundTime` when paused
6. **Resume Detection**: App checks authentication status and time since last auth
7. **Re-authentication**: If needed, app sets `_isAuthenticated = false` and shows LockScreen

#### Anti-Loop Protection

**Problem**: Biometric authentication dialogs cause app lifecycle changes (inactive → resumed) that could trigger re-authentication loops.

**Solution**: 5-second grace period after successful authentication
- Record `_lastAuthenticationTime` when authentication succeeds
- Skip re-authentication requirement if less than 5 seconds have passed
- This allows biometric prompt lifecycle changes without triggering loops

### Key Features

#### Automatic Locking
- **Trigger**: App backgrounded (AppLifecycleState.paused)
- **Behavior**: Next app resume requires biometric authentication
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access to unlocked app

#### Manual Locking
- **Trigger**: Lock button in home screen app bar
- **Behavior**: Immediately returns to lock screen
- **Use Case**: User wants to lock app without backgrounding

#### Biometric Integration
- **Primary Method**: Device fingerprint/face recognition
- **Fallback**: Device PIN/pattern (managed by OS)
- **Compatibility**: Graceful handling of unsupported devices

#### State Persistence
- **Session-based**: Authentication state only persists during app session
- **No Storage**: No persistent authentication tokens or session data
- **Fresh Start**: Each app launch requires authentication

## Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. Authentication Loop Prevention
**Challenge**: Biometric prompts trigger app lifecycle changes that could cause infinite authentication loops.

**Solution**: Time-based grace period (5 seconds) after successful authentication to ignore lifecycle changes caused by the authentication process itself.

### 2. Lifecycle State Complexity
**Challenge**: Android app lifecycle has multiple states (inactive, paused, resumed, hidden) that can occur during normal operation.

**Solution**: Focus on `paused` (true backgrounding) and `resumed` (returning to foreground) states, with smart filtering based on authentication timing.

### 3. Callback Management
**Challenge**: Clean communication between parent app state and child authentication screens.

**Solution**: Simple callback pattern with `onAuthenticated()` and `onLogout()` functions passed as parameters.

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model
- **Physical Device Access**: Prevents unauthorized access if device is left unlocked
- **App Switching**: Protects against shoulder surfing during app switching
- **Background Screenshots**: Prevents sensitive data exposure in app switcher

### Security Boundaries
- **Device Security**: Relies on device's biometric/PIN security
- **OS Integration**: Uses platform-native authentication APIs
- **No Custom Auth**: Avoids implementing custom authentication schemes

### Limitations
- **Device Dependency**: Security limited by device's biometric capabilities
- **OS Vulnerabilities**: Inherits any vulnerabilities in platform authentication
- **Physical Bypass**: Cannot protect against device unlock bypass methods

## Configuration Options

### Timing Parameters
```dart
// Grace period to prevent authentication loops
final justAuthenticated = _lastAuthenticationTime != null && 
    DateTime.now().difference(_lastAuthenticationTime!).inSeconds < 5;
```

**Adjustable Values**:
- **Grace Period**: Currently 5 seconds, can be adjusted based on device performance
- **Background Threshold**: Currently any pause triggers re-auth, could add minimum time threshold

### Authentication Methods
- **Biometric Only**: Could be configured to require only biometric (no PIN fallback)
- **Custom Timeout**: Could add configurable timeout for automatic locking
- **Sensitivity Levels**: Could add different security levels (immediate, delayed, manual-only)

## Testing Scenarios

### Functional Testing
1. **Initial Launch**: ✅ Requires authentication
2. **Successful Auth**: ✅ Shows home screen with passwords
3. **Background/Resume**: ✅ Requires re-authentication
4. **Manual Lock**: ✅ Lock button works immediately
5. **Authentication Loop**: ✅ No infinite loops during biometric prompt

### Edge Cases
1. **Device Compatibility**: ✅ Graceful fallback for unsupported devices
2. **Authentication Failure**: ✅ Proper error handling and retry
3. **App Termination**: ✅ Fresh authentication required on restart
4. **Rapid Backgrounding**: ✅ Grace period prevents false triggers

### Security Testing
1. **Background Protection**: ✅ App locks when backgrounded
2. **Manual Lock**: ✅ Immediate locking when requested
3. **Session Management**: ✅ No persistent authentication state
4. **Biometric Bypass**: ✅ Falls back to device PIN/pattern

## Performance Impact

### Memory Usage
- **Minimal Overhead**: Only adds a few DateTime variables and boolean flags
- **No Persistent Storage**: No additional database or file operations
- **Efficient Callbacks**: Simple function pointer callbacks

### CPU Usage
- **Lifecycle Monitoring**: Minimal overhead from WidgetsBindingObserver
- **Time Calculations**: Simple DateTime arithmetic operations
- **State Updates**: Standard Flutter setState() calls

### Battery Impact
- **No Background Processing**: No continuous monitoring or timers
- **Event-Driven**: Only responds to OS lifecycle events
- **Native Integration**: Uses platform-optimized biometric APIs

## Future Enhancements

### Configurable Security Levels
- **Immediate**: Lock on any app switch
- **Delayed**: Lock after configurable timeout
- **Manual**: Only lock when explicitly requested

### Advanced Authentication
- **Multi-Factor**: Combine biometric + PIN
- **Custom PIN**: App-specific PIN independent of device
- **Pattern Lock**: Custom pattern authentication
