# Native Design System Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for creating a native-quality design system that makes Simple Vault feel like a first-party application on both Android and iOS platforms. The design must eliminate any visual indicators that this is a Flutter app and instead provide platform-appropriate experiences.

6. WHEN in high contrast mode THEN the system SHALL increase contrast ratios and use stronger color differentiation
7. WHEN displaying gradients THEN the system SHALL use subtle, platform-appropriate gradient styles

### Requirement 3: Micro-Interactions and Animation System

5. WHEN providing feedback THEN the system SHALL use haptic feedback for important actions (iOS) or vibration (Android)
6. WHEN scrolling lists THEN the system SHALL use platform-appropriate overscroll effects
7. WHEN showing state changes THEN the system SHALL animate between states smoothly (locked/unlocked, empty/filled)

### Requirement 4: Typography and Content Hierarchy

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear and readable text that follows platform conventions so that information is easy to scan and understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying headings THEN the system SHALL use platform-appropriate type scales (Material Type Scale / iOS Typography)
2. WHEN showing body text THEN the system SHALL maintain optimal line height and letter spacing for readability
3. WHEN displaying passwords THEN the system SHALL use monospace fonts with appropriate character spacing
4. WHEN showing labels THEN the system SHALL use consistent capitalization (sentence case for iOS, title case for Android)
5. WHEN text is too long THEN the system SHALL use platform-appropriate truncation with ellipsis
6. WHEN supporting accessibility THEN the system SHALL respect user font size preferences and scale appropriately
7. WHEN displaying numbers THEN the system SHALL use tabular figures for proper alignment in lists

### Requirement 5: Component Library and Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent interface elements throughout the app so that I can predict how interactions will work and build muscle memory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying buttons THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling with primary, secondary, and tertiary variants
2. WHEN showing input fields THEN the system SHALL use platform-appropriate focus states and validation styling
3. WHEN displaying cards THEN the system SHALL use consistent elevation, corner radius, and padding
4. WHEN showing lists THEN the system SHALL use consistent item heights, spacing, and divider styles
5. WHEN displaying modals THEN the system SHALL use platform-appropriate presentation styles and dismiss gestures
6. WHEN showing navigation THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent header styles and back button behavior
7. WHEN displaying badges THEN the system SHALL use consistent sizing, colors, and positioning for status indicators

### Requirement 6: Responsive Layout System

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work well on different screen sizes and orientations so that I can use it comfortably on phones, tablets, and foldable devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using on tablets THEN the system SHALL adapt layouts to use available screen space effectively
2. WHEN rotating the device THEN the system SHALL maintain usability and visual hierarchy in landscape mode
3. WHEN using on foldable devices THEN the system SHALL adapt to different screen configurations
4. WHEN displaying on large screens THEN the system SHALL use appropriate maximum widths to maintain readability
5. WHEN showing dialogs THEN the system SHALL size appropriately for the screen and avoid covering important content
6. WHEN displaying lists THEN the system SHALL use appropriate column layouts on wider screens
7. WHEN showing forms THEN the system SHALL group related fields and use appropriate spacing for the screen size

### Requirement 7: Accessibility and Inclusive Design

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the app to work with assistive technologies so that I can use all features regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful labels and descriptions for all interactive elements
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL provide clear focus indicators and logical tab order
3. WHEN using voice control THEN the system SHALL support voice commands for common actions
4. WHEN displaying colors THEN the system SHALL not rely solely on color to convey important information
5. WHEN showing animations THEN the system SHALL respect reduced motion preferences and provide alternatives
6. WHEN displaying text THEN the system SHALL support dynamic type sizing up to accessibility sizes
7. WHEN providing feedback THEN the system SHALL use multiple modalities (visual, haptic, audio) when appropriate

### Requirement 8: Performance and Rendering Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth animations and instant responses so that the app feels fast and native rather than sluggish or janky.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN animating transitions THEN the system SHALL complete animations within platform-appropriate durations
3. WHEN loading images THEN the system SHALL use progressive loading and appropriate placeholder states
4. WHEN rendering complex layouts THEN the system SHALL optimize for GPU rendering and avoid jank

6. WHEN displaying large datasets THEN the system SHALL use virtualization to maintain performance
7. WHEN running on older devices THEN the system SHALL gracefully reduce animation complexity to maintain performance

### Requirement 9: Platform Integration Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to integrate with platform features so that it feels like part of the operating system rather than an isolated application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using system sharing THEN the app SHALL integrate with platform share sheets and intents
2. WHEN receiving deep links THEN the system SHALL handle URLs and navigate to appropriate screens
3. WHEN using shortcuts THEN the system SHALL support platform-specific shortcut systems (iOS Shortcuts, Android App Shortcuts)
