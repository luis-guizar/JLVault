# Peer-to-Peer Sync System Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a revolutionary peer-to-peer synchronization system that allows Simple Vault users to sync their password vaults directly between devices without relying on cloud services. This system must provide secure, efficient, and user-friendly synchronization while maintaining the app's privacy-first philosophy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Device Discovery and Pairing

**User Story:** As a premium user, I want to easily discover and pair my devices so that I can sync my password vaults without complex setup procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN devices are on the same local network THEN the system SHALL automatically discover other Simple Vault instances using mDNS/Bonjour
2. WHEN initiating pairing THEN the system SHALL generate a unique QR code containing encrypted pairing information
3. WHEN scanning a pairing QR code THEN the system SHALL establish a secure connection and exchange device certificates
4. WHEN pairing devices THEN the system SHALL require biometric authentication on both devices for security
5. WHEN pairing is complete THEN the system SHALL store device certificates locally and display paired device names
6. WHEN devices are not on the same network THEN the system SHALL provide manual pairing options via QR codes
7. WHEN pairing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 2: Secure Communication Protocol

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my sync data to be encrypted end-to-end so that no one can intercept or read my password data during transmission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing connections THEN the system SHALL use TLS 1.3 with certificate pinning for transport security
2. WHEN exchanging keys THEN the system SHALL use ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) for perfect forward secrecy
3. WHEN encrypting sync data THEN the system SHALL use AES-256-GCM with unique nonces for each message
4. WHEN authenticating messages THEN the system SHALL use HMAC-SHA256 to prevent tampering
5. WHEN rotating keys THEN the system SHALL generate new session keys for each sync session
6. WHEN detecting tampering THEN the system SHALL abort the sync and alert the user
7. WHEN storing connection data THEN the system SHALL never store session keys persistently

### Requirement 3: Sync Protocol and Conflict Resolution

**User Story:** As a user with multiple devices, I want my changes to sync reliably and conflicts to be resolved intelligently so that I don't lose data or have inconsistent vaults.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN syncing vaults THEN the system SHALL use vector clocks to track causality and detect conflicts
2. WHEN conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL use "last writer wins" with user override options for important conflicts
3. WHEN syncing incrementally THEN the system SHALL only transmit changed records since last sync
4. WHEN sync is interrupted THEN the system SHALL resume from the last successful checkpoint
5. WHEN detecting data corruption THEN the system SHALL request full resync from a trusted device
6. WHEN merging changes THEN the system SHALL preserve all metadata including creation and modification timestamps
7. WHEN sync completes THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity using checksums

### Requirement 4: Selective Sync and Vault Management

**User Story:** As a user with multiple vaults, I want to control which vaults sync to which devices so that I can keep work and personal data separate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring sync THEN the system SHALL allow users to select which vaults sync to each paired device
2. WHEN creating a new vault THEN the system SHALL ask which devices should receive the vault
3. WHEN a vault is marked as "local only" THEN the system SHALL never sync that vault to other devices
4. WHEN removing a vault from sync THEN the system SHALL optionally delete the vault from target devices
5. WHEN a device is offline THEN the system SHALL queue vault changes and sync when the device reconnects
6. WHEN sync permissions change THEN the system SHALL immediately update sync behavior for affected vaults
7. WHEN displaying sync status THEN the system SHALL show which vaults are synced to which devices

### Requirement 5: Network Topology and Connection Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want sync to work reliably across different network conditions so that my devices stay synchronized whether I'm at home, work, or traveling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN devices are on the same WiFi network THEN the system SHALL use direct local network connections for fastest sync
2. WHEN devices are on different networks THEN the system SHALL use NAT traversal techniques (STUN/TURN) to establish connections
3. WHEN direct connections fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to relay servers for connectivity
4. WHEN network conditions change THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect and resume sync
5. WHEN bandwidth is limited THEN the system SHALL compress sync data and prioritize critical changes
6. WHEN multiple devices are available THEN the system SHALL sync with the most recently active device first
7. WHEN connections are unstable THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and retry logic

### Requirement 6: Offline Queue and Sync Scheduling

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want my changes to be queued when devices are offline so that everything syncs automatically when connectivity is restored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a device is offline THEN the system SHALL queue all vault changes with timestamps and metadata
2. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically begin syncing queued changes
3. WHEN the queue is large THEN the system SHALL prioritize recent changes and critical data first
4. WHEN battery is low THEN the system SHALL defer non-critical sync operations to preserve battery
5. WHEN on metered connections THEN the system SHALL ask user permission before syncing large amounts of data
6. WHEN sync fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL exponentially increase retry intervals to avoid battery drain
7. WHEN the queue exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL compress or merge similar changes to save space

### Requirement 7: Device Management and Security

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my paired devices and revoke access if a device is lost or stolen so that I maintain control over my data security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing paired devices THEN the system SHALL show device names, last sync time, and sync status
2. WHEN renaming devices THEN the system SHALL allow custom device names for easy identification
3. WHEN revoking device access THEN the system SHALL immediately prevent that device from syncing
4. WHEN a device is revoked THEN the system SHALL optionally send a remote wipe command to clear vault data
5. WHEN detecting suspicious activity THEN the system SHALL alert the user and suggest security actions
6. WHEN devices haven't synced recently THEN the system SHALL show warnings about potentially lost devices
7. WHEN managing devices THEN the system SHALL require biometric authentication for security-sensitive operations

### Requirement 8: Sync Performance and Optimization

**User Story:** As a user with large password vaults, I want sync to be fast and efficient so that I don't have to wait long for my devices to be updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN syncing small changes THEN the system SHALL complete sync in less than 5 seconds on local networks
2. WHEN syncing large vaults THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and estimated completion times
3. WHEN compressing data THEN the system SHALL use efficient compression algorithms to minimize transfer size
4. WHEN syncing frequently THEN the system SHALL use delta compression to only send actual changes
5. WHEN multiple changes exist THEN the system SHALL batch operations to reduce network round trips
6. WHEN sync is in progress THEN the system SHALL allow users to continue using the app without blocking
7. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL use parallel connections for large data transfers

### Requirement 9: Sync Status and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visibility into sync status and any issues so that I know when my devices are up to date and can troubleshoot problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sync is active THEN the system SHALL show a subtle progress indicator in the UI
2. WHEN sync completes successfully THEN the system SHALL show a brief confirmation with timestamp
3. WHEN sync fails THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages with suggested solutions
4. WHEN devices are out of sync THEN the system SHALL show warnings and offer to initiate sync
5. WHEN viewing vault details THEN the system SHALL show last sync time and which devices have the vault
6. WHEN sync conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide a clear interface for resolving conflicts
7. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide detailed sync logs for advanced users

### Requirement 10: Privacy and Data Protection

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want assurance that P2P sync maintains the same privacy standards as local storage so that my data remains completely private.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN syncing data THEN the system SHALL never store unencrypted vault data on any intermediate servers
2. WHEN using relay servers THEN the system SHALL ensure relay servers cannot decrypt sync traffic
3. WHEN logging sync activity THEN the system SHALL never log sensitive data or encryption keys
4. WHEN sync fails THEN the system SHALL not leave temporary unencrypted data on the filesystem
5. WHEN devices are paired THEN the system SHALL use unique device identifiers that cannot be linked to users
6. WHEN sync is complete THEN the system SHALL clear all temporary sync data from memory
7. WHEN implementing telemetry THEN the system SHALL only collect anonymous performance metrics, never user data
