# Freemium Architecture Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for transforming Simple Vault into a freemium Android password manager with premium features unlocked via one-time purchase through Google Play Billing. The system must provide a compelling free tier while offering significant value in the premium tier through advanced features like multiple vaults, TOTP, P2P sync, and vault health monitoring.

**Platform Scope:** This application is designed exclusively for Android devices and will use Android-specific APIs and design patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Freemium Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want to implement a freemium model so that users can try the app for free and upgrade to premium features with a one-time purchase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first opens the app THEN the system SHALL provide full access to free tier features without requiring payment
2. WHEN a user attempts to access a premium feature THEN the system SHALL display an upgrade prompt with clear value proposition
3. WHEN a user completes a premium purchase through Google Play THEN the system SHALL immediately unlock all premium features without requiring app restart
4. WHEN a user purchases premium THEN the system SHALL store the license locally using Android Keystore and verify it on each app launch
5. IF the license verification fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to free tier features with a 7-day grace period
6. WHEN a user reinstalls the app THEN the system SHALL restore premium features using Google Play Billing purchase history

### Requirement 2: Feature Gating System

**User Story:** As a free user, I want to understand what premium features are available so that I can make an informed decision about upgrading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN a free user accesses the TOTP section THEN the system SHALL display the premium TOTP authenticator benefits
4. WHEN displaying premium features THEN the system SHALL show clear "Premium" badges and descriptions
5. WHEN a free user uses premium features during trial THEN the system SHALL track trial usage and show remaining time
6. IF a user's trial expires THEN the system SHALL gracefully lock premium features while preserving existing data

### Requirement 3: Multiple Vaults Architecture

**User Story:** As a premium user, I want to organize my passwords into separate vaults (Personal, Work, Family) so that I can better manage different aspects of my digital life.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a premium user creates a new vault THEN the system SHALL allow custom naming, icon selection, and color coding
2. WHEN switching between vaults THEN the system SHALL maintain separate encryption keys for each vault
3. WHEN a user deletes a vault THEN the system SHALL require confirmation and securely wipe all vault data
4. WHEN displaying vaults THEN the system SHALL show vault-specific statistics (password count, last accessed, security score)
5. WHEN a vault is locked THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication to access that specific vault
6. WHEN importing data THEN the system SHALL allow users to specify which vault to import into

### Requirement 4: TOTP Authenticator Integration

**User Story:** As a premium user, I want built-in TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) generation so that I can manage both passwords and 2FA codes in one secure app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new account THEN the system SHALL provide an option to add TOTP via QR code scanning or manual entry
2. WHEN displaying an account with TOTP THEN the system SHALL show the current 6-digit code with countdown timer
3. WHEN a TOTP code is about to expire THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the remaining time (red when <10 seconds)
4. WHEN copying a TOTP code THEN the system SHALL automatically copy to clipboard and show confirmation
5. WHEN backing up data THEN the system SHALL include encrypted TOTP secrets in the backup
6. WHEN the device time is incorrect THEN the system SHALL warn users that TOTP codes may be invalid

### Requirement 5: Vault Security Health Dashboard

**User Story:** As a premium user, I want a security health dashboard so that I can identify and fix password security issues across my vaults.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the security dashboard THEN the system SHALL display an overall security score (0-100) for each vault
2. WHEN analyzing passwords THEN the system SHALL identify weak passwords (length <12, no complexity)
3. WHEN detecting reused passwords THEN the system SHALL group accounts using identical passwords
4. WHEN checking for breaches THEN the system SHALL integrate with HaveIBeenPwned API to identify compromised passwords
5. WHEN displaying security issues THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations for each problem
6. WHEN a user fixes a security issue THEN the system SHALL update the security score in real-time
7. WHEN passwords are old (>1 year) THEN the system SHALL suggest rotation with priority indicators

### Requirement 6: Import/Export System

**User Story:** As a premium user, I want to import passwords from other password managers and export my data so that I can migrate easily and maintain data portability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing from 1Password THEN the system SHALL support .1pux and .opvault file formats
2. WHEN importing from Bitwarden THEN the system SHALL support JSON export format with field mapping
3. WHEN importing from LastPass THEN the system SHALL support CSV format with automatic field detection
4. WHEN importing from browsers THEN the system SHALL support Chrome, Firefox, and Safari password exports
5. WHEN importing data THEN the system SHALL detect and offer to merge duplicate entries
6. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL provide encrypted backup files with password protection
7. WHEN exporting selectively THEN the system SHALL allow users to choose specific vaults or categories to export

### Requirement 7: Peer-to-Peer Sync Architecture

**User Story:** As a premium user, I want to sync my passwords between devices without using cloud services so that I maintain complete privacy while having access across devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN devices are on the same network THEN the system SHALL automatically discover other Simple Vault instances
2. WHEN pairing devices THEN the system SHALL use QR code exchange for secure initial authentication
3. WHEN syncing data THEN the system SHALL use end-to-end encryption with device-specific keys
4. WHEN conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL use timestamp-based resolution with user override options
5. WHEN a device is offline THEN the system SHALL queue changes and sync when connection is restored
6. WHEN managing devices THEN the system SHALL allow users to view, rename, and revoke access for paired devices
7. WHEN syncing selectively THEN the system SHALL allow users to choose which vaults sync to which devices

### Requirement 8: Native Design System

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to feel like a native platform application so that it integrates seamlessly with my device's design language and doesn't feel like a generic cross-platform app.
